This repository contains the code and resources for the AQI Index and Heatwave Prediction project, developed as part of the Academic Grand Challenge on Climate Change organized by the Telangana government. The objective of the project was to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) and identify potential heatwaves using machine learning models, providing insights into climate trends and their impacts.

# Introduction
Air pollution and rising temperatures are critical environmental issues. This project aims to:

# Predict AQI levels for a given region and time.
Identify the likelihood of heatwave occurrences.
Provide actionable insights into environmental trends to aid policymakers.

# Features
Data Analysis: Comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis to uncover key trends.
Predictive Modeling: Machine learning models to forecast AQI and predict heatwave occurrences.
Visualization: Interactive visualizations to better understand the data and predictions.

# Data
The project uses publicly available datasets, including:

Air Quality Index (AQI) data from government and independent sources.
Temperature and weather-related data.
Historical records of heatwave occurrences.

# Data Preprocessing
Missing values imputed using statistical methods.
Feature engineering performed to derive meaningful insights.

# Methodology
Data Cleaning: Cleaning and preprocessing the raw datasets.
Feature Engineering: Creating additional features such as temperature anomaly and pollutant ratios.

# Model Selection: Evaluated multiple machine learning models including:
Random Forest
XGBoost
Linear Regression

# Evaluation:
Metrics used: RMSE, MAE for AQI prediction and Accuracy, F1 Score for heatwave prediction.

# Results
Achieved 83% accuracy for heatwave prediction.
Successfully predicted AQI levels with accuracy of 87%.
Identified key environmental factors influencing AQI and heatwaves.
